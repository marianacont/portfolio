    <h1>Let's play Checkers!</h1>
    <h3>A <em>drag and drop</em> game</h3>
    <p><strong>Rules:</strong></p>
    <p>Pieces are always moved diagonally and can be moved in the following ways:
        <br>
        Diagonally in the forward direction (towards the opponent) to the next dark square.
        <br>
        If there is one of the opponent's pieces next to a piece and an empty space on the other side, you jump your opponent and remove their piece. You can do multiple jumps if they are lined up in the forward direction. *** note: if you have a jump, you have no choice but to take it.</p>
