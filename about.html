        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I'm Mariana Conti, I live at a small city called Santa Rosa de Calamuchita, in Córdoba, Argentina. I studied Social Communication at Córdoba University, but recently I decided to change course and get into web development. I'm taking courses at Educación IT and learning by my own.
        <br>My goal is to become a Front-end web developer, with a broad command of the relevant languages such as HTML, CSS and Javascript. In addition to being updated on the latest technologies and practices.
        <br>My previous career nourished me with knowledge that I consider very useful also in this field, since it trained me to develop effective communications that take into account all the subjects involved during the discursive process.
